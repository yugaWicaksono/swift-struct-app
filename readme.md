# A simple app to genereta swift struct from JSON

When I am developing in Swift I found that I have to generate lot of structs as response from API requests. This work can be tedious and error prone. So I thought, why not create a simple GUI app in python that convert JSON to struct. Thi is my attempt 


python version: 3.8.2
